I have done research in two main fields: the logical foundations of quantum
theory, mostly during my undergraduate years; and, throughout my Master’s,
the neuroscience of psychedelic substances. Below, 
I briefly discuss both of those research programmes, starting
with the latter. (All referenced links are in

<h1>The entropy of psychedelic-induced brain states</h1>

To measure the entropy of brain activity from, e.g., correlated time series of
functional magnetic ressonance imaging (fMRI), one usually applies thresholding
procedures over the original data set. For example, the Pearson (linear)
correlation between $n$-dimensional fMRI time series $x_i$ and $x_j$ is given
by

$$R_{ij} = \frac{\langle X_i~X_j \rangle}{\sigma_i \sigma_j},$$

where $X_i = x_i - \langle x_i \rangle$, $\langle\,\cdot\,\rangle$ is an average
over $n$, and the variance is given by $\sigma_i^2$. Crucially, $R_{ij}\in[-1,+1]$,
so that there is an uncountable infinite of possible values for the time series
correlation. Nonetheless, the thresholding procedure consists in defining a
threshold value, say, $\xi$, such that 

The standard practice of “data pruning”
has provided the literature remarkable discoveries, examples of which include scale-free and
small-world characteristics in brain networks. However, the thresholding
procedure clearly injects a degree of arbitrariness to the final, thresholded
data set.  

Starting with my Master’s, I focused on developing novel techniques
to calculate the entropy of brain activity recorded via functional
magnetic ressonance imaging (fMRI). It is customary to apply
thresholding procedures in order to estimate an entropy of fMRI
time series, that is, one essentially prunes the data so that usual
approaches can be employed.
