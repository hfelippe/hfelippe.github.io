<h3>Hi, I’m Helcio!</h3>

I hold an M.S. in Physics from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte
([UFRN](https://ufrn.br/en)), where I worked with applications of statistical
physics to the neuroscience of psychedelic-induced altered brain states. Prior
to that, I researched the logical foundations of quantum mechanics at the 
Federal University of Santa Catarina ([UFSC](https://en.ufsc.br/)), from where
I graduated with a B.S. in Physics.

My main interest is using well-established physical theories to uncover the
mechanisms underlying complex systems’ behavior. I am particularly interested
in developing computational and mathematical tools to model scaling laws in
networked systems, self-organized criticality in biological processes, and the
emergence of cognition in the human brain.
